This is the planet Earth role playing game. To play, you must first pick a character. Once you pick a character, you must pick an opponent. Attack the opponent by clicking the "Attack!" button. But remember, your opponent will counter attack. If you defeat all of the opponents, you will become the champion of planet Earth!

Developing this game allowed me to practice the JavaScript framework, jQuery.
